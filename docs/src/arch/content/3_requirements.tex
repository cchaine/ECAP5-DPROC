    \subsubsection{Instruction decoding}

      \begin{content}
          Figure \ref{fig:instructionencoding} outlines the different instruction encodings for the RV32I instruction set. The \texttt{opcode} parameter is a unique identifier for each instruction. The instruction encoding is infered from the opcode as there can only be one encoding per opcode.

      \paragraph{Immediate encoding}

          Only one immediate value can be encoded in one instruction. The value can be reconstructed from fragments of the following format : imm[x] representing the x\textsuperscript{th} bit or imm[x:y] representing bits from the x\textsuperscript{th} to the y\textsuperscript{th} both included.
