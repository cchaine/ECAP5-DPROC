  \hline
  \multirow{6}{*}{0} & The memory interface presents a valid address on \texttt{adr\_o} \\
  & The memory interface presents valid data on \texttt{dat\_o} \\
  & The memory interface asserts \texttt{we\_o} to indicate a WRITE cycle \\
  & The memory interface presents a bank select \texttt{sel\_o} to indicate where it sends data. \\
  & The memory interface asserts \texttt{cyc\_o} to indicate the start of the cycle. \\
  & The memory interface asserts stb\_o to indicate the start of the phase. \\
  \hline
  \multirow{1}{*}{1} & \texttt{ack\_i} is asserted in response to \texttt{stb\_o} to indicate latched data. It shall be noted that wait states may be inserted before asserting \texttt{ack\_i}, thereby allowing it to throttle the cycle speed. Any number of wait states may be added. \\
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{2} & The memory interface deasserts \texttt{stb\_o} and \texttt{cyc\_o} to indicate the end of the cycle. \\
  & The \texttt{ack\_i} signal is deasserted in response to the deassertion of \texttt{stb\_o}.\\
