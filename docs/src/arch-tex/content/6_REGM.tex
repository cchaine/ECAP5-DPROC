\section{Register Module}

  \subsection{Interface}

    \begin{content}
        The register module implements the 32 internal registers of ECAP5-DPROC. It has two reading port and one writing port. The signals are described in table \ref{tab:regm-interface}.

  \subsection{Specification}

    \req{D\_REGM\_REGISTERS\_01}{
        The register module shall implement 32 general purpose registers ranging from \texttt{x0} to \texttt{x31}.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_01
      ]

    \req{D\_REGM\_READ\_PORT\_01}{
        The \texttt{rdata1\_o} signal shall be set synchronously to the value of the register pointed by \texttt{raddr1\_i}.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_01
      ]

    \req{D\_REGM\_READ\_PORT\_02}{
        The \texttt{rdata2\_o} signal shall be set synchronously to the value of the register pointed by \texttt{raddr2\_i}.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_01
      ]

    \req{D\_REGM\_WRITE\_PORT\_01}{
        The value of the register pointed by \texttt{waddr\_i} shall be set to \texttt{wdata\_i} on the rising edge of \texttt{clk\_i} when \texttt{write\_i} is asserted.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_01
      ]

    \req{D\_REGM\_WRITE\_PORT\_02}{
        When both reading and writing to the same registers, the read operation shall be performed before the write operation.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_01
      ]

    \req{D\_REGM\_WRITE\_PORT\_03}{
        The value of register \texttt{x0} shall not be changed during a write operation, remaining the constant zero.
      }[
        derivedfrom=F\_REGISTERS\_02
      ]
